## Background
Narrative, a common practice in human life, has long been a focus of humanities research. As an arc has its shape, a story also has its shape. By unconsciously adhering to the familiar modes, story arcs create echoes among readers, thus engaging them in the narrative.

While emotional modes were described as “unconscious”, or “unobserved” ([Reagan et al., 2016, p. 2](https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0093-1)), they are anticipated to manifest in “definite forms” ([Jung, 1969, p. 100](https://www.jungpage.org/learn/articles/analytical-psychology/527-the-concept-of-the-collective-unconscious)), for example, the specific content of stories. 

We believed that this technological tool could similarly capture such “definite forms”, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the summarized emotional modes. 

## This study
This study examines emotional modes in 1,222 adventure stories from Project Gutenberg. Firstly, emotional modes were extracted from data, following the method of [Reagan et al. (2016)](https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0093-1). Furthermore, we extended the interpretation of the extracted emtional modes by analyzing their alignment with the subjects of their corresponding stories.

> **Fig.** Summary of our key findings (modes and general subjects). We also analyzed the alignment between emotional modes and specific subjects in the formal analysis.

The findings highlight the reliability of data-driven methods in uncovering universal emotional patterns in adventure narratives. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the content and subjects of stories are often consistent with their underlying emotional modes. This consistency provides a foundation for interpreting both the similarities and differences among these modes. 

By emphasizing methodological robustness, our study offers valuable new insights into narrative universals and enhances the interpretability of emotional modes in storytelling.
