## Background

Sentence-final particles (SFPs) are pervasive in spoken Cantonese for expressing speakers’ attitudes. Compared to spoken Cantonese, spoken Mandarin Chinese, a language syntactically similar to Cantonese, equally uses SFPs to express moods but SFPs therein are more “general in meaning and broad”. For example:

| (1) | 佢    | 喺度      | 揾          | 乜嘢      | [喎]  |
|-----|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------|
|     | Keoi5 | hai2-dou6 | wan2        | je5       | [wo5] |
|     | 她/他 | 在        | 找          | 东西      |       |
|     | Tā    | zài       | zhǎo        | dōng-xī   |       |
|     | they  | are       | looking for | something |       |
|     |       |           |             |           |       |

Example (1) means '[It is said that] they are looking for something' in English. Therein, Example (1b) expresses *evidentiality* about the fact stated with the SFP *wo5*, with no equivalent in either Mandarin Chinese or English. 

SFPs are semantically weak and optional when producing sentences in human languages. If their usage is only *contextual*, they should be dispensible in the evolution of language. By contrast, if their pervasiveness and richness are not trivial, SFPs' influence on the mood should be not only contextual but also *structural*. 

It thus implies that Cantonese SFPs should have strong connections with other language components within sentences, which is strucutrally distinguishable.

## This study

This study explores the global and local features of SFPs in both spoken Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese using two part-of-speech-based (POS-based) dependency networks. 

Results show that 
1. Globally, spoken Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese networks exhibit centralization and scale-free properties, reflecting the communication efficiency of human languages. 
- However, spoken Cantonese manifests weaker centralization properties, as demonstrated by the diversity of its edges. 
- Moreover, SFPs in spoken Cantonese have a greater degree and in-degree than those in Mandarin Chinese, indicating a stronger ability to form syntactic connections with other POSs in the language structure. 
2. Locally, Cantonese SFPs display more extensive mood expression devices, notably differing in PART-NOUN (discourse:sp), PART-ADV and PART-ADJ dependencies compared to Mandarin Chinese. 
- Additionally, specific examples illustrate how Cantonese SFP usage differs from Mandarin Chinese, showcasing their distinct discourse functions. 

The findings suggest that communication efficiency is a cross-lingual universal, while spoken Cantonese is distinctive in its use of diverse SFPs to express moods. This study may shed new light on adapting the complex network approach to explore the similarities and differences across human languages.
