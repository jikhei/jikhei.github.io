This post is about the blog, especially I will talk about:
- ðŸ”§ Why did I build this blog, and
- ðŸ‘‡ How did I modify the original template.

::github{repo="saicaca/fuwari"}

## Why blog?
I am curious about anything that I can figure out with code.

Before this blog, I built another personal blog with [`hexo`](https://hexo.io/zh-cn/) in (about?) 2022.
