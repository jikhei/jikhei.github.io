This post is about the blog, especially I will talk about:
- ðŸ”§ Why did I build this blog, and
- ðŸ‘‡ How did I modify the original template.

## Why blog?
I am curious about anything that I can figure out with code.

Before this blog, I built another personal blog with `hexo` in (about?) 2022. But soon, I didnâ€™t update it because I didnâ€™t know what I should upload and share with readers. I am more used to communication on microblogs, sharing transient ideas with a few words. Blog, on the other hand, is not the way.

However, as I started my study as a postgraduate, I found it a recovery to write down my thoughts with more words. Writing English usually happens in a formal context, e.g., academic writing and emails. I want this blog to be a start for my personal English writing.

Pragmatically, it is also a good way for me to think about how to distill complex ideas from lengthy academic papers into short blog posts.
